## Sorting

### What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order (ascending or descending). It helps in organizing and optimizing data for quick access and better readability.

---

### Common Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Time Complexity: O(n²).

2. **Selection Sort**:
   - Finds the smallest element and places it at the beginning of the array.
   - Time Complexity: O(n²).

3. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
   - Time Complexity: O(n²).

4. **Merge Sort**:
   - Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n).

5. **Quick Sort**:
   - Divides the array using a pivot and sorts smaller subarrays recursively.
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n).

6. **Heap Sort**:
   - Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n).

| Algorithm       | Best Case    | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n)         | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort  | O(n²)        | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n)         | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)             |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n)         |
| Heap Sort       | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(1)             |

## Searching

### What is Searching?

Searching is the process of finding an element within a data set. It helps retrieve data efficiently, especially in large collections.

---

### Common Searching Algorithms

1. **Linear Search**:
   - Checks each element sequentially.
   - Time Complexity: O(n).

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Divides the sorted data into halves and eliminates half the elements at each step.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n).

3. **Jump Search**:
   - Skips fixed blocks of elements and then performs a linear search within the block.
   - Time Complexity: O(√n).

4. **Exponential Search**:
   - Starts searching with an exponentially increasing range.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n).

| Linear Search    | O(1)         | O(n)         | O(n)       | Unsorted Array   |

## Merging

### What is Merging?

Merging is the process of combining two or more sorted data structures into a single sorted structure.

---

### How Merging Works

1. **Step 1**: Start by comparing the smallest elements of each data structure.
2. **Step 2**: Add the smaller element to the result and move to the next element in that data structure.
3. **Step 3**: Repeat until all elements are merged.

---

### Applications of Merging

1. **Merge Sort**:
   - Uses merging to sort subarrays.
   
2. **Database Joins**:
   - Combines sorted tables based on a common key.

3. **File Merging**:
   - Combines large sorted files efficiently.
